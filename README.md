# Quantum- A Text Adventure Game (In Haitus)

Khai Dinh wrote the story for this text adventure and I built it with C++ and Qt windows application. 

I regret using Qt since right now it's troublesome for users to download and build the application. So I might convert this into a front end web application once Khai completes the story.
